Biological evolution and collective decision-making essentially describe the same phenomenon: how information changes in a process of selection, merging and differential propagation. Problems of optimal group composition and decision-making thus have close analogies in evolutionary theory and revolve around a well-known evolutionary problem: whatâ€™s good for the group is not necessarily best for the individual, creating a conflict between cooperation and selfishness. I will study the benefits and costs of (social and genetic) information exchange, combining theory from evolutionary biology and social sciences. My research will on the one hand help understanding the evolutionary stability of cooperation (e.g. sexual recombination, group foraging), and on the other hand provide information about optimal group sizes and diversity in human decisions.
