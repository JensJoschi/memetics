Biological evolution and collective decision-making essentially describe the same phenomenon: how information changes in a process of selection, merging and differential propagation. Problems of optimal group composition and decision-making thus have close analogies in evolutionary theory (table 1) and revolve around a well-known evolutionary problem: what’s good for the group is not necessarily best for the individual, creating a conflict between cooperation and selfishness. I will study the benefits and costs of (social and genetic) information exchange, combining theory from evolutionary biology and social sciences. My research will on the one hand help understanding the evolutionary stability of cooperation (e.g. sexual recombination, group foraging), and on the other hand provide information about optimal group sizes and diversity in human decisions.

#Work program  
My work will revolve around four main topics, which are currently represented by different research disciplines (evolutionary biology, library sciences, sociology, psychology). First, I will study how parents invest in offspring phenotypes under unpredictable environmental conditions. Investment strategies include phenotypic plasticity, canalization and bet-hedging, and I will assess how the costs, benefits and constraints of these strategies, both on the individual and on the group level, affect the evolution of the “decision-making” process. Secondly, I will explain scientific progress with a memetic framework: the evolution of scientific concepts is the result of selection, recombination and differential citation of publications. In contrast to standard models of evolution, I will emphasize multi-level (group) selection processes, as publications represent meta-organisms in which authors and ideas differ in selective pressures (cooperation vs. selfish replication) despite shared fitness components. Thirdly, I will unite sexual selection theory, i.e. the evolutionary theory concerned with finding partners for information (DNA) exchange, with theories regarding the formation of social groups. Lastly, I will research the repercussions of dissent as one group-level cost of individual plasticity. I will focus on gifted (highly intelligent and creative) students, and assess how their extraordinary phenotypic plasticity affects social integration and subsequent academic success. This last work package hence links to the three other topics, while also forming the basis for my teaching commitment.  

The work program is currently under development and will depend on the interest of collaboration partners. I attached a few research ideas on the next pages.

#Specific ideas   
**Costs and limits of bet-hedging and individual plasticity, group diversity and group-level plasticity**  

Collective decisions and cooperation first require individual decisions. Phenotypic plasticity describes how a genotype may react to environmental conditions, and bet-hedging describes strategies to limit risk under uncertainty. Because no organism is infinitely plastic, it has been argued that there must be some costs and limits of plasticity, and I argue that similar reasoning should apply to bet-hedging and other strategies. Thus, I am currently expanding the framework on costs and limits of plasticity to those of bet-hedging strategies, arithmetic mean maximization and canalization. I have searched the Web of Science database for costs, constraints or limits of bet-hedging, plasticity and canalization, and found nearly 5000 search results. Concentrating on review and modelling papers, I currently review the costs and limits that are described to date, and integrate them in an individual-based model. As part of the proposal I plan to conduct a meta-analysis on the data papers to evaluate the empirical evidence for the theoretical cost and limit categories.  

I have recently placed plasticity, bet-hedging, arithmetic mean maximization and canalization into a common framework, and explained them along a continuum of reaction norm shapes. With the proposed project I will extend the framework in two novel directions: First, cooperation may create a novel or larger response to environmental pressures than individual plasticity (e.g. cooperative hunting, sexual recombination) alone, but it may also impose further costs and limits. I will describe the benefits, costs and limits of group-level plasticity and group diversity, and explore how interactions between group-level and individual-level strategies shape the evolution of cooperation. This framework may explain e.g. why sexual recombination with one partner can exist, but why multiparental inheritance (i.e. group-level cooperation in genetic information exchange) does not . Secondly, I will extend the framework to the human decision-making process, thereby discussing costs and limits of core convictions, intelligence/creativity and risk avoidance as individual-level costs, and costs of diversity and innovation as group-level costs and benefits.  
  
Potential approaches include: literature review/opinion papers, meta-analysis, modelling, experimental work on costs of bet-hedging  

**A memetics-based approach to analyse conflict and cooperation in scientific networks**  
Science is a decision-making process. Modern publication databases archive communication in highly organized manner, including any information exchange among individual contributions (citation networks). While we do work towards a common goal, i.e. increasing human knowledge, current publishing and hiring practices also impose pressure to be selfish. One may hence expect an intermediate level between selfishness and selfless cooperation in publication behavior.  

I will use Dawkin’s concept of memetics as heuristic to explain the evolution of scientific information. I define a meme as the name for a scientific concept, e.g. “intelligence”[1] . Once created, the name of a meme remains constant, but the concept it encompasses may evolve, just like genes that may acquire new functions. For example, the definition of “intelligence” may refer to multiple uncorrelated abilities (Gardners concept of multiple intelligences), two traits (“crystalline” and “fluid” intelligence), or a general intelligence factor (g-Factor). The frequency of these different presentations of a meme is comparable to the allele frequency of a gene. Scientific memes are embedded in publications, so a publication can be regarded as the analogue of a phenotype; its content is a “memotype” that consists of multiple connected memes. When publications are cited, memotypes recombine and memes propagate, thus citations are a measure of “meme flow”. Importantly, the “mortality” (retraction rate) of publications is extremely low, so fitness can be simply defined as citations a memotype receives (including the citation success of the “offspring” publications). In other words, the fitness of a memotype is entirely determined by its attractiveness for citation and the only selection pressure occurring is sexual selection. The research environment (current state of knowledge, available research tools, political factors) influences the attractiveness of a publication throughout its life time, but the currently most important factor is the micro-environment in which a publication is “born” (i.e. the journal). Thus, pre-publication peer review plays a major role in determining fitness of a memotype.  

There are many further analogies that could be described (e.g. “research parasitism”, reproductive/citation skew, dispersal by international mobility), but there are also two important differences to standard models of genetic evolution that deserve attention. First, the mode of reproduction resembles multiparental inheritance, i.e. publications do not propagate by making nearly identical copies of themselves (asexual) or by recombining information from exactly two parent publications (sexual recombination), but by rearranging information from multiple sources. Secondly, publications are written by authors whose “academic fitness” is tightly coupled with publication fitness (e.g. h-index), but who nevertheless also follow own agendas. Specifically, authors may be more interested in finding scientific truth than in propagating a certain scientific idea, and they may impose these ideals on others during peer-review. This situation is similar to meta-organisms (e.g. host-endosymbiont relationships) in which the interacting species differ in generation times and selective pressures. Under such conditions multi-level selection theories may apply, so the group selection pressures applied by the authors might outweigh the benefit of egoistic self-replication of ideas.  

The combination of multiparental inheritance and group selection lends to a much larger spectrum between selfishness and group-level cooperation. Publication databases such as the Web of Knowledge offer detailed information about meme flow among publications, and I use these databases to demonstrate the utility of a memetics framework. I will pick some memes (e.g. “intelligence”, “meme”, “animal personality”) and track how they evolved in response to varying environmental pressures, which factors led to sympatric and allopatric speciation of ideas, how to apply the breeder’s equation, and how meme flow may break down metapopulation architecture. I will then explore which factors favour group selection and whether we can track its influence in publication databases.  

Potential approaches include: reviews, modelling, data- mining

**Sexual selection, cooperation and group composition**  
Sexual selection theory describes the selection pressures affecting mate choice, and thereby the formation of cooperation and (genetic) information exchange. Sexual selection is central to evolutionary theory, so the theoretical and empirical literature is vast. The formation of groups is also the basis of sociology, with an equally developed theory. Yet, the two theories have been developed largely independent from another, so a unification may lead to novel testable predictions.  

I will develop an individual-based model to simulate the maintenance of sexual recombination under significant group selection pressure. I will then conduct a social experiment to validate the model: I will use a modified 2-person prisoner’s dilemma, in which multiple players are grouped in teams and receive group-level bonusses depending on the number of team members choosing to cooperate. The strength of group selection, as well as information about the bonus provided will be varied, and the outcomes of the social experiment will be compared with that of the individual-based model.  

Cooperation with multiple genotypes is, essentially, an extension of sexual recombination.  I will engineer an n-person prisoner’s dilemma (i.e. multiple players need to cooperate) with similar group pressures, and again compare the outcomes with an individual-based model.  

The proposed experiments are meant to transfer insights from sexual selection theory to sociology, but they can only offer limited insight in the evolution of cooperation in biological systems. To demonstrate the validity of the models for living systems, I will conduct experimental evolution experiments. The study system is open to discussion and will depend on potential collaborators. As a placeholder I here introduce one potential experiment in very general tresm:

I will use a naturally occurring symbiosis of bacteria. Each species can survive on their own, but because metabolic capabilities differ among species, the benefit for the species community is largest when the species cooperate. I will engineer the system such that cooperation confers a small cost, e.g. release of a growth inhibitor in small doses, but that continued cooperation over n generations will provide benefits that offset these costs [2]. In addition, I let multiple populations compete and impose group selection pressure after n * m generations, with both the strength of selection and m being variable. This experiment should provide results analogous to the n-person prisoner’s dilemma under group pressure.  

I will use the results to explain the evolution of sex and cooperation, as well as social group formation when group members are significantly selfish (e.g. hiring decisions). My research will pay particular attention to the interaction between group constraints and individual costs and limits (WP1). Lastly,  I am also concerned with interactions between the two modes of information transfer, i.e. with remnants of past evolution on current social processes (e.g. gender inequalities, reliance on status symbols).  

This part of the proposal requires significant further investment, as I do not know enough about sociological models to see where sociological and evolutionary theories may clash.  

[These benefits do not require genetic engineering; one could, for example, offer a reward based on concentrations of a metabolite after n generations]  

**Application: gifted education in university settings**  
See also repository "intelligence".  

One key finding of sexual selection theories is that unconventional phenotypes are often selected against, although they might indeed be better adapted to the environment (e.g. inconspicuous plumage). Similar mechanisms may be at work when choosing members of a group for cooperation: individuals that deviate from the norm and fail to carry the right signals may be excluded from the decision process, independent of their true potential to contribute. This form of “sexual” selection[3] may be one case in which group-level processes pose a cost to individual-level phenotypic plasticity (see WP 1, WP3). I will study the factors that allow integration of dissent, and how they can improve decision-making.  

In human groups the individuals with highest phenotypic plasticity, including the most intelligent and creative minds, face systematic barriers, both in social interaction  and in education, . Especially in university teaching these special needs are not generally considered. I am currently seeking collaborations (including education scientists) for a review/opinion paper on the current state of gifted education in STEM. Moreover, I am looking for collaboration partners to survey the challenges that academic parents of gifted children face, and how the challenges affect scientific careers. As part of the proposal, I will not only continue with these efforts, but also conduct quantitative research on the prevalence, attrition risk and structural barriers that gifted and creative students face in STEM . Depending on collaboration opportunities, I am also interested in expanding the research to other forms of neurodiversity (e.g. autism, dyslexia, ADHD). I will further strengthen collaborations between the university and gifted societies (e.g. Mensa), schools with tracks for gifted children, and research on talent development. Lastly, dedication to gifted education and talent development form the basis of my teaching philosophy.  

Potential approaches include: reviews, interviews, surveys, outreach (connections to gifted societies), teaching
